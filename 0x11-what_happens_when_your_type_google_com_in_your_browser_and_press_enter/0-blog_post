        <h1>What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com and Press Enter</h1>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what happens behind the scenes when you type <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">https://www.google.com</a> in your browser and press Enter? It's a fascinating journey that involves several crucial steps and components of the internet. Let's break down the entire process from start to finish.</p>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>1. DNS Request</h2>
            <p>The first step in this process is the Domain Name System (DNS) request. DNS acts like the internet's phonebook, translating human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.</p>
            <p><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your browser checks its cache to see if it has recently resolved the domain.</li>
                <li>If not, the request is sent to a DNS resolver, often provided by your ISP or a public DNS service like Google DNS or Cloudflare.</li>
                <li>The resolver checks its own cache and, if necessary, queries other DNS servers to find the IP address associated with www.google.com.</li>
                <li>The IP address is returned to your browser, allowing it to initiate a connection to the web server.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>2. TCP/IP</h2>
            <p>With the IP address in hand, your browser initiates a connection to Google's servers using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) over the Internet Protocol (IP).</p>
            <p><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The browser creates a TCP connection to the IP address on port 443 (the default port for HTTPS).</li>
                <li>This involves a three-way handshake:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>SYN:</strong> Your browser sends a synchronization packet to the server.</li>
                        <li><strong>SYN-ACK:</strong> The server responds with a synchronization-acknowledgment packet.</li>
                        <li><strong>ACK:</strong> Your browser sends an acknowledgment packet back to the server.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>3. Firewall</h2>
            <p>During the TCP connection, the data packets pass through various firewalls. Firewalls are security systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.</p>
            <p><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Firewalls at both your end (your computer/router) and Google's end examine the packets to ensure they meet security criteria.</li>
                <li>Any suspicious or unauthorized packets are blocked to prevent malicious activities.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>4. HTTPS/SSL</h2>
            <p>With the TCP connection established, the next step is to establish a secure connection using HTTPS, which stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure.</p>
            <p><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your browser and the server perform an SSL/TLS handshake to create a secure, encrypted connection.</li>
                <li>This involves the exchange of cryptographic keys and the server presenting an SSL certificate, which your browser verifies to ensure it is connecting to the legitimate Google server.</li>
                <li>Once the handshake is complete, all data transmitted between your browser and the server is encrypted, ensuring privacy and integrity.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. Load Balancer</h2>
            <p>After establishing a secure connection, the request is handled by Google's load balancer. Load balancers distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed, optimizing resource use and ensuring reliability.</p>
            <p><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The load balancer receives your request and forwards it to one of the many Google web servers based on factors like server load, geographical proximity, and availability.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>6. Web Server</h2>
            <p>The web server is responsible for handling your HTTP request, which in this case is for Google's homepage.</p>
            <p><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The web server processes your request and decides how to respond. It may serve static content directly (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images) or forward the request to an application server for further processing.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>7. Application Server</h2>
            <p>For dynamic content and complex logic, the web server forwards the request to an application server. Google's application servers run various services and applications that generate the dynamic content you see on the page.</p>
            <p><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The application server processes the request, potentially querying databases, performing computations, and assembling the content to be returned to your browser.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>8. Database</h2>
            <p>If the requested content requires data stored in databases (like user-specific information, search indexes, etc.), the application server interacts with Google's databases.</p>
            <p><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The application server sends a query to the database.</li>
                <li>The database processes the query, retrieves the necessary data, and sends it back to the application server.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Response Assembly and Delivery</h2>
            <p>Once all necessary data and content are gathered, the application server sends it back to the web server, which then delivers the assembled HTTP response to your browser.</p>
            <p><strong>Step-by-Step:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The browser receives the response, which includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources.</li>
                <li>The browser parses and renders the content, displaying the Google homepage on your screen.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
